Ms Emily Chapman, the Assistant Publisher of Environmental Research Letters, informed me recently that my [Myanmar mangrove deforestation paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab666d) was shortlisted for the [Editor's Choice Awards](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1748-9326/page/Best_article_awards) for the articles published in 2020. 

That was such unexpected news, especially in the midst of what's going on in my life as of late! But I'm afraid I did not win the award in the end (winners receive a gift and certificate).

Although my article did not win the award, the publisher still recognised the value of our contribution, and that is an honour in itself.

They featured all shortlisted articles on the [Anniversary Collections and Highlights](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/1748-9326/page/Anniversary_Collections_and_Highlights) of the publication website (you can check it out under Published Highlights of 2020).
